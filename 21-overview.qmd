X-13ARIMA-SEATS is organized by *specs*.
Specs are software modules that deal with a particular task needed in the seasonal adjustment process.
For example, the `transform` spec deals with the initial transformations of the time series.
This spec will take care of if a series should be adjusted in logarithms.

## Main specs

Some specs, like the `transform` and the `regression` spec, are used in most seasonal adjustment processes.
Others fulfill a particular function and are used only occasionally.
For example, the `history` spec allows an analysis of the revision history and is only called for diagnostical purposes.
Other specs are mutually exclusive.
You can choose `x11` or `seats` to decompose a time series, but not both.
@tbl-main-specs lists the main specs of X-13 and describes what they do.

## Interactions between specs

X-13 specs interact with each other.
For example, once a series is transformed, it is usually passed to the `regression` and `arima` specs, which estimate a regARIMA model.
To come up with a good model, it uses the `automdl` spec to determine a good ARIMA model automatically.
To correct outlier values, it collaborates with the `outlier` spec.
Once the series is modeled, it is decomposed either by the `seats` or the `x11` spec.
@fig-spec-interaction shows the interaction between the main specs in a typical seasonal adjustment run.

## Specs Arguments

Within specs, there are *arguments*.
Spec arguments guide the behavior of the spec.
For example, the `function` argument in the `transform` spec can be set to `"auto"`, `"none"`, `"log"`, `"sqrt"`, `"inverse"` or `"logistic`".
The default is set to `"auto"`, which causes an automated model evaluation between `"log"` and `"none"`.
There are many other arguments, and the X-13 Manual [@census17] is the canonical reference.
This book will list and explain the frequently used arguments while skipping some of the more exotic ones.

## Addressing specs from R

In the R package seasonal, spec argument combinations can be directly fed to the `seas()` function.
For example, to turn off the log transformation in the `AirPassengers` example from @sec-a-minimal-example, we can specify the following:

```{r}
m_no_log <- seas(AirPassengers, transform.function = "none")
summary(m_no_log)
```

As you can see from the lower part of the summary, transform is now set equal to none.
Note that the change in the `transform` argument has also affected the other specs.
The ARIMA model is different now, and a leap-year adjustment is performed.
We will discuss the working of the transform spec in more detail in the next chapter.

## Less frequently used specs

While the main specs appear in most seasonal adjustment processes, other specs are less often used.
Some of them have a diagnostic purpose.
The `spectrum` spec, for example, draws and analyses the spectrum of a time series, similar to the R base function `spectrum()`.
Other specs are more elaborate.
For example, the `history` spec produces a sequence of runs from a sequence of truncated versions of the time series and allows the analysis of potential revisions.
The `slidingspans` spec models various parts of the time series and has a similar purpose as `history`.
All diagnostics specs are listed in @tbl-diagnosics-specs.

: Diagnostic specs {#tbl-diagnosics-specs}

The `force` and the `composite` spec are special-purpose specs.
The former enforces the yearly totals of the seasonally adjusted series to be equal to those of the original series.
The latter allows a comparison of indirect and direct seasonal adjustments.
@tbl-diagnosics-specs gives an overview of the special-purpose specs.

: Special purpose specs {#tbl-diagnosics-specs}

Finally, a few specs are not covered in this book.
Some of them are vintage specs that were important in earlier versions of X-13 but were superseded by other specs.
It is generally recommended to use `regression` instead of `x11regression` and `automdl` instead of `pickmdl`.
Other specs have a purely technical purpose.
For example, the `series` spec provides X-13 with the data, starting date, and frequency.
In R, this is handled by seasonal and will not be covered.

+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Spec name       | What it does                                                                                                                                    |
+=================+=================================================================================================================================================+

## Main user choices

While we will cover each spec in more detail, this section provides a few examples of frequent user choices.
As we saw in the previous chapter, by default, seasonal uses defaults that work well in many circumstances.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of deviations from the defaults.
The default options of `seas()` are listed as explicit arguments and are discussed in the arguments section of the help page of

### Using X11

While `seas()` calls SEATS by default, X11 is often easier to use.
To perform a seasonal adjustment on `AirPassengers` with X11, we need to activate the `x11` spec.

```{r}
m_x11 <- seas(AirPassengers, x11 = "")
```

An empty string `""` tells `seas()` to use the spec without an argument.
Alternatively, you can also use an empty list, `list()`.
If more than one mutually exclusive spec is included in `seas()`, specs are overwritten according to the priority rules shown in @tbl-priority-rules

+----------------------+----------------+
| Procedure            | Priority rules |
+======================+================+
| Model selection      | 1.  `arima`    |
|                      | 2.  `pickmdl`  |
|                      | 3.  `automdl`  |
+----------------------+----------------+
| Adjustment procedure | 1.  `x11`      |
|                      | 2.  `seats`    |
+----------------------+----------------+

: If more than one mutually exclusive spec is included, specs are overwritten according to priority rules. {#tbl-priority-rules}

This is why the default SEATS procedure in the introductory example was overwritten by the specification of `x11 = ""`.

### Turning off automatic ARIMA modeling

By default, the `automdl` spec finds a good ARIMA model.
By specifying the `model` argument of the `arima` spec, the automated modeling is deactivated.
Instead of the automatically chosen (0 1 1)0 1 1) ARIMA model, the following estimates an (1 1 0)1 1 0) model.

```{r}
m_arima <- seas(AirPassengers, arima.model = c(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0))
summary(m_arima)
```

### Turning off AIC testing for outlier detection and regressors

By default, `seas()` evaluates the presence of weekday and Easter effects and checks for outliers in the data.
Both can be turned off:

```{r}
m_no_auto <- seas(AirPassengers, regression.aictest = NULL, outlier = NULL)
summary(m_no_auto)
```

In practice, many spec argument combinations can be extracted via the `static()` functions, which will be demonstrated in the next chapter.
Alternatively, the seasonalview package offers a graphical user interface that allows you to click various spec argument combinations.

``` r
m <- seas(AirPassengers)
view(m)
```
