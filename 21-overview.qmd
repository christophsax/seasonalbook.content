## History

In official statistics, seasonal adjustment has a long tradition.
The original X-11 software was developed by the US Census Bureau in the 1960s, and later improved by Statistics Canada [@dagum80].
Subsequent software packages by the US Census Bureau were called X-12-ARIMA [@findley98] and X-13ARIMA-SEATS (or X-13, for short) [@monsell07].
Today, X-11 is still used as a name for filter-based seasonal adjustment methods within X\nobreakdash-13.
Meanwhile, TRAMO-SEATS, developed by the Bank of Spain [@caporello01], offers an alternative model-based approach to seasonal adjustment.

In its most recent version, X-13 offers these two seasonal adjustment methods in a single command-line tool, written in Fortran.
The National Bank of Belgium has created an alternative Java-based implementation called JDemetra+ [@eurostat17] which is also widely deployed by statistical agencies.
One of either the TRAMO-SEATS or X-11 method of seasonal adjustment is used by almost all (government) statistical offices throughout the world.
