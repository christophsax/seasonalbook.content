This book will teach you how to do seasonal adjustment in R, using X13-ARIMA-SEATS.
The audience will be both R users who want to learn about seasonal adjustment as well as seasonal adjustment practitioners, who are interested in using R.
The book will be tailored to the practical applications of seasonal adjustment within R.

## Seasonal Adjustment {.unnumbered}

Many time series exhibit a regular seasonal pattern over the year.
US unemployment, for example, is usually higher from January to March, and again in June and July.
Similarly, retail sales tend to peak with the Christmas season.
This seasonal behavior is regualar and predictable.
The goal of seasonal adjustment is to estimate and remove the seasonal component from a time series.

Why do we want to do this?
Seasonal data is usulally hard to interpret.
For example, if we want to learn from the US unemployment rate if the economy is moving out of a recession during certain months, we want the labor market data be free from seasonal effects.

## X13-ARIMA-SEATS {.unnumbered}

Fundamentally, seasonal adjustment decomposes a time series into a **trend**, a **seasonal** and an **irregular** component and removes the seasonal component from the data.
There are many ways to perform this decomposition.
This book focuses on a particular one, X13-ARIMA-SEATS (X13, for short), the seasonal adjustment software developed by the United States Census Bureau.
X13 offers an elaborate toolkit to perform the most advanced seasonal adjustment.

## R {.unnumbered}

This book will teach you how to use X13 in R, through the *seasonal* package, which offers access to all features of X13, with a ususally much simpler syntax.
The required X-13 binaries are provided by the *x13binary* package, and automatically included in *seasonal*.
The next chapter provides a minimal example to get you started in less than five minutes.

## Target audience {.unnumbered}

We write this book for two primary audiences: The first focus is on current practitioners of seasonal adjustment who are interested in learning how to implement in R.
This audience includes researchers from statistical agencies who want to include the scripting language features of R to evaluate properties of their seasonal adjustments.

The second focus is on current R users who want to learn seasonal adjustment.
We are able to leverage the readers knowledge of R to make learning seasonal adjustment easier.
We will feature interesting applications outside of official statistics, such as the seasonal adjustment of business data.

The book tries to be as practical as possilbe.
It usually starts with a practical problems, and shows how to solve it in a cookbook style.
Formal derviations are usually avoided.
Each chapeter ends with a case study that discusses a real-live example of the topic.

## History of X13 {.unnumbered}

In official statistics, seasonal adjustment has a long tradition.
The original X-11 software was developed by the US Census Bureau in the 1960s, and later improved by Statistics Canada [@dagum80].
Subsequent software packages by the US Census Bureau were called X-12-ARIMA [@findley98] and X-13ARIMA-SEATS (or X-13, for short) [@monsell07].
Today, X-11 is still used as a name for filter-based seasonal adjustment methods within X-13.
Meanwhile, TRAMO-SEATS, developed by the Bank of Spain [@caporello01], offers an alternative model-based approach to seasonal adjustment.

In its most recent version, X-13 offers these two seasonal adjustment methods in a single command-line tool, written in Fortran.
The National Bank of Belgium has created an alternative Java-based implementation called JDemetra+ [@eurostat17] which is also widely deployed by statistical agencies.
One of either the TRAMO-SEATS or X-11 method of seasonal adjustment is used by almost all (government) statistical offices throughout the world.
