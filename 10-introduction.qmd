Many time series exhibit a regular seasonal pattern over the year.
US unemployment, for example, is usually higher from January to March, and again in June and July.
Similarly, retail sales tend to peak with the Christmas season.

To model the underlying structure of these series, any regular (seasonal) patterns are estimated and removed from the data.
For example, to see if the economy is moving out of a recession during certain months, one wants the labor market data be free from such seasonal effects.
Seasonal adjustment decomposes a time series into a trend, a seasonal and an irregular component and removes the seasonal component from the data.
