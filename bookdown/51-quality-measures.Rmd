# Quality assessment

This section focuses on diagnostic tools for seasonal adjustment.
This will be written as a stand-alone section as well as a continuance of prior sections.
The idea here is that many readers may be interested in checking the quality of their adjustments but not need help performing it.

## Quality measures

- What is a good seasonal adjustment?

- M statistics

- Other statistics available in X13
