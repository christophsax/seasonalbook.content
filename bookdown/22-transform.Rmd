## Transform

- Discuss multiplicative vs additive adjustment

- How to use the transform spec

- Case Study idea: Decide between log vs non-log transformation

One of the first choices to make when modeling a time series is whether or not it needs to be transformed. 
X-13A-S only decides between log and no transformation.
This choice is made by comparing the AICC value of an Airline model fit to the log transformed series and the original series. 
For all practical purposed this is an effective choice and can be left to the program to decide. 
Note, if your series has negative values it can not be log transformed and no transform is automatically selected by X-13. 

We can see the results of the transformation tests:

```{r}
library(seasonal)
m <- seas(AirPassengers)
udg(m, c("aictest.trans.aicc.nolog", "aictest.trans.aicc.log"))
```

We see the AICC for log transformation is lower and hence selected. 
The summary of the seasonal object `summary(m)` tells us this with `Transform: log` displayed.
