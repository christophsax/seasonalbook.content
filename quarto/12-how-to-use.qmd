- Overview of the book

- The Book wants to give concrete advise in case of a problem.

- Ideally we want to have a quick check list that gives readers a starting point where to look for further advice. That could be something like a Cheat Sheet (https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) with quick advise and chapter references.

- For each section, we want to provide a concrete and informative case study. Some examples are provided in the outline.
