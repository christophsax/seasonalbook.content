SEATS = "Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series"

Both X-11 method and SEATS assume the observed time series is a function of latent (unobserved) components.
$$
X_t = S_t + N_t
$$
where $S_t$ is a seasonal component and $N_t$ is a non-seasonal component.

Usually the non-seasonal component is broken down further into trends, cycles, transitory, etc.

$$
X_t = T_t + S_t + I_t
$$

Ultimately, both X-11 and SEATS estimate the components $T_t$, $S_t$, $I_t$ by passing moving average filters over the forecast extended series.

*X-11 Filters*:

* finite set of empirically developed moving average filters
*	fixed filtering seen as easier to use (less statistical machinery)

*SEATS filters*:

* specifies stochastic models for unobserved components
* derives seasonal adjustment filters from these models
* infinite number of possible filter choices
* requires more statistical machinery 

Sometimes SEATS includes a transitory component in its decomposition:

$$ X_t = T_t + S_t + R_t + u_t $$

The transitory component captures short, erratic behavior 
that is not white noise, sometimes associated with awkward 
frequencies.

* The variation from the transitory component should not 
contaminate the trend or seasonal, and removing it allows SEATS to obtain smoother, more stable trends and seasonal components.
* In the final decomposition, the transitory and irregular 
components are usually combined.
* SEATS does not always estimate a transitory component


## Quick refresher on ARIMA models and notation

The remaining of the SEATS section will heavily rely on the autoregressive and moving-average operators $\phi(B)$ and $\theta(B)$ where $B X_t = X_{t-1}$.

If $X_t$ follows and ARIMA($p$, $d$, $q$) model:
$$
\phi(B) X_t = \theta(B) a_t 
$$

$$
(1 - \phi_1 B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d X_t = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots \theta_q B^q) a_t
$$

For example, in an ARIMA(2,0,1) we are modeling $X_t$ as:

$$
X_t = \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + a_t + \theta_1 a_{t-1}
$$

and all model information is contained in $\phi(B)$ and $\theta(B)$.
Moreover, for any specified $\phi(B)$ and $\theta(B)$ that satisfy certain causality criteria there exists a unique Wold decomposition
$$
\phi(B) X_t = \theta(B) a_t  
$$

$$
X_t = \frac{\theta(B)}{\phi(B)} a_t = \Psi(B) a_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \psi_k a_{t-k}
$$

## SEATS Assumptions

* The linearized series can be represented by an ARIMA model which captures the stochastic structure of the series (Linearized series = series with regression effects removed)
* After differencing each with the ARIMAâ€™s differencing polynomial, the components are orthogonal (uncorrelated)

SEATs decomposes the autoregressive polynomial by its roots associating them with different latent components. 
For example, roots near seasonal frequencies are associated with the seasonal component and roots near zero are associated with the trend component. 
$$
\phi(B) = \phi_T(B) \cdot \phi_S(B) \cdot \phi_R(B).
$$

Hence we have,
$$
X_t = 
\frac{\theta(B)}{\phi(B)} a_{t} = 
\frac{\theta_T(B)}{\phi_T(B)} a_{T,t} +
\frac{\theta_S(B)}{\phi_S(B)} a_{S,t}  +
\frac{\theta_R(B)}{\phi_R(B)} a_{R,t}  + u_t
$$

If the spectra of all components in non-negative the decomposition is admissible, SEATS finds admissible models for components
$$ \phi_T(B) T_t = \theta_T(B) a_{T, t} $$
$$ \phi_S(B) S_t = \theta_S(B) a_{S, t} $$
$$\phi_R(B) R_t = \theta_R(B) a_{R, t} $$
*Problem:* Infinite number of models that yield the same aggregate. The choices differ in how white noise is allocated among the components.
*Solution:* Canonical Decomposition: SEATS uses the method of Pierce, Box-Hillmer, Tiao and Burman:

* Put all the white noise into the irregular components
* Maximize the variance of the irregular
* Minimizes the variance of the stationary transforms of the other components

This is called the *Canonical Decomposition*.
