    "text": "Seasonal Adjustment\nMany time series exhibit a regular seasonal pattern over the year. US unemployment, for example, is usually higher from January to March and again in June and July. Similarly, retail sales tend to peak during the Christmas season. This seasonal behavior is regular and predictable. The goal of seasonal adjustment is to estimate and remove the seasonal component from a time series.\nWhy do we want to do this? Seasonal data is usually hard to interpret. For example, if we want to learn from the US unemployment rate if the economy is moving out of a recession during certain months, we want the labor market data to be free from seasonal effects."

    "text": "X-13ARIMA-SEATS\nFundamentally, seasonal adjustment decomposes a time series into a trend, a seasonal, and an irregular component. Seasonal adjustment is then the act of removing the seasonal estimate from the observed series. There are many ways to perform this decomposition. This book focuses on a particular one, X-13ARIMA-SEATS (X-13, for short), the seasonal adjustment software developed by the United States Census Bureau. X-13 offers an elaborate toolkit to perform seasonal adjustment. The software allows users to control all aspects of the modeling process or alternatively, to use automated methods to make all modeling choices. In the text we will try to present material with this in mind. Throughout we offer suggestions about when built-in automatic method are sufficient (and sometimes even preferred) and when an analyst can get the most ``bang for the buck’’ to control modeling options themselves."

It should be noted that the seasonal package is not a re-coding of the X-13 software. Instead it is a translation from R to the X-13 software. This translation is done under the hood and practitioners need not concern themselves with this inner working of the package. However, we make this point such that users understand that conceptually anything that can be done in the native X-13ARIMA-SEATS software, either from the command line or HTML version, can be done in the seasonal R package. Also this means if additional clarification or information about seasonal adjustment is desired, the X-13 manual or research papers can be consulted. Any example or methods found via the X-13 documentation can be easily translated to the R seasonal package. In fact, all examples from the X-13 manual can be seen run in the R seasonal package at http://www.seasonal.website/examples.html. The required X-13 binaries are provided by the x13binary package and automatically included in seasonal. The next chapter provides a minimal example to get you started in less than five minutes."

The US Census Bureau developed the original X-11 software in the 1960s, Statistics Canada (Dagum 1980) continued the development afterward. The following software packages by the US Census Bureau were called X-12-ARIMA (Findley et al. 1998) and X-13ARIMA-SEATS (or X-13, for short) (Monsell 2007). X-11 is still used as a name for filter-based seasonal adjustment methods within X-13.

    "text": "2.2 A minimal example\nOnce the package is installed, you can load it in the usual way:\n\nlibrary(seasonal)\n\nThe seas() function provides the core functionality of the package. By default, seas calls the automatic procedures of X-13 to perform a seasonal adjustment that works well in most circumstances:\n\nseas(AirPassengers)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> seas(x = AirPassengers)\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>           Weekday          Easter[1]         AO1951.May  MA-Nonseasonal-01  \n#>          -0.00295            0.01777            0.10016            0.11562  \n#>    MA-Seasonal-12  \n#>           0.49736\n\nThe first argument of seas is a time series of class ts. ts objects are frequently used in base R and are useful to store monthly, quarterly, or annual data. We restrict our attention to monthly and quarterly series. This is done for two reasons; first is these are the main frequencies handled by X-13, second, this sampling frequency make conceptual understanding of statistical methods, such as linear filters, easier to grasp. The AirPassengers example series is included in base R and shows monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. seas() returns a seas object that contains the necessary information on the adjustment performed on this time series; we can assign it to a variable:\n\nm <- seas(AirPassengers)\n\nThere are several functions and methods for \"seas\" objects. The final function returns the adjusted series. The plot method shows a plot with the unadjusted and the adjusted series.\n\nplot(m)\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the adjusted series is much less volatile than the original one because the seasonal component was removed from the original series. But the adjusted series is not entirely smooth. This is because it still contains the irregular component.\nThis constitutes a crucial point about seasonal adjustment: It only removes regular, predictable movements, not irregular ones. In the adjusted series, we can see a decrease in airline passengers in 1953 and between 1957 and 1958. These decreases were difficult to discover in the original series.\nThe summary method displays an overview of the model, very similar to the one produced by other R classes (eg lm or numeric):\n\nsummary(m)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> seas(x = AirPassengers)\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>                     Estimate Std.

    "text": "2.3 Where to go from here\nseas(AirPassengers) produces a good seasonal adjustment of the airline passengers time series. If you are very new to seasonal adjustment, the automated routines of X-13 and seasonal produce an adjustment that works well in most circumstances.\nThe command seas(AirPassengers) has invoked a large number of specs of X-13. spec is X-13 slang for a module within the software. X-13 is built on top of twenty specs that perform various subtasks of seasonal adjustment. Some specs are required most of the time (e.g., regression), while others are optional (e.g., seats) or purely technical (e.g., spans shortens the time series in use). Chapter 3 discusses the available specs in more detail.\nThis book teaches you how to use and fine-tune the individual specs and deal with concrete data problems.\n\n2.3.1 Fundamentals\nSpecifically, the command seas(unemp) has invoked the following fundamental specs – they are involved in most adjustments and are covered in the first part of the book:\n\nTransform\n\nA decision on initial transformation was made. The automated procedures concluded that a log transformation was made and a multiplicative seasonal adjustment model, rather than an additive model, was estimated. Chapter 4 discusses the choices. Since transform is a relatively simple spec, it is a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the spec idea.\n\nRegression\n\nAn automated model search concluded that AirPassengers is best modeled by an (0 1 1)(0 1 1) ARIMA model. Chapter 5 explains what that means and how such a model structure is determined and estimated.\n\nSEATS / X11\n\nSeasonal decomposition is performed by SEATS. SEATS is one of the two options for decomposing a series and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7. The alternative, X11, is discussed in Chapter 6.\n\n\n2.3.2 Data issues\nThe command seas(AirPassengers) has also dealt with various data issues, which are covered in the second part of the book:\n\nHoliday\n\nSignificant Easter effects have been found in AirPassengers and were removed from the adjusted series. Moving holidays like Easter or Chinese New Year are vital in seasonal adjustment since they may significantly impact the behavior of many time series. For AirPassengers, the number of passengers is higher in months with Easter. Moving holiday effects will be discussed in Chapter 8.\n\nWeekday\n\nNot every month has the same number of weekdays. Since many activities (such as air traveling) differ between weekends and weekdays, this constitutes another predictable component. In AirPassengers, there are fewer passengers on a weekday than during a weekend, and the automated procedures decided to remove the effect. These effects are discussed in Chapter 9.\n\nOutliers\n\nCertain data points may be well out of the ordinary. These outliers are a problem for the modeling and adjustment process. An automated procedure scanned the series for outliers and found an additive outlier on May 1951. This outlier is shown in the plot above, too. Outliers are discussed in Chapter 10.\n\nSeasonal Breaks\n\nThe seasonal pattern in AirPassengers looks relatively stable. Some time series, however, show abrupt changes in the seasonal pattern. Chapter 11 discusses them and shows how to deal with seasonal breaks.\n\n\n2.3.3 Additional issues\nThe third part of the book deals with additional issues:\n\nPresence of seasonality\n\nWhile the presence of seasonality in AirPassengers is prominent, this is not always the case. If a series has no seasonal pattern, there is no need for a seasonal adjustment. If it is adjusted anyway, the process adds noise to the series and should be avoided. Chapter 12 shows how seasonality can be detected and how to decide whether an adjustment should be made or not.\n\nAnnual constraining\n\nUsually, a seasonal adjustment may affect the annual values of a time series. In part, this is by design. The number of weekdays may differ between years, so the adjusted annual values may be different too. In part, this may be an artifact of the adjustment process. X-13 offers tools to enforce the annual values of the adjusted series to be the same as the original one. Chapter 13 shows how to constrain annual value and whether it is a good idea.\n\nIndirect vs. direct adjustment\n\nOften, a seasonal adjustment may be performed on individual series or on an aggregate of multiple series. X-13 offers tools that let you compare these two possibilities. Chapter 14 discusses the options and helps you to decide which one is better.\n\n\n2.3.4 Quality assessment\nAdjusting a series with the automated procedure is straightforward. But is the resulting series a reasonable adjustment? The fourth part helps you to decide between competing seasonal adjustment models.\n\nQuality measures\n\nIn the lower part, the summary of the adjustment model shows various quality measures: The AICc and BIC information criterion and the QS, the Box-Ljung, and the Shapiro statistic. None of them shows any significance (indicated by one or several stars), which is a good sign. Various quality measures and their interpretation is shown in Chapter 15.\n\nRevisions\n\nWhen comparing seasonal adjustment models, the stability of the model and the series is often an important consideration. One does not want to get a different series with a new data point. X-13 offers tools to analyze revisions. Chapter 16 discusses them and helps you to decide which model to pick."

The default options of seas() are listed as explicit arguments and are discussed in the arguments section of the help page of\n\n3.6.1 Using X11\nWhile seas() calls SEATS by default, X11 is often easier to use.

These effects can be well-known and established, such as the length of a period or leap-year effects, or they can be more subjective such as a modification for a workers’ strike. We will see how this comes into the regARIMA model in Chapter 5. We can think of prior-modification factors as events or corrections made to your data that are fixed throughout the adjustment process. These prior modification factors can also be permanent (default) or temporary. Permanent modifications are excluded from the final seasonal adjustment. Temporary modifications are removed while calculating seasonal factors but added back to the seasonally adjusted series.\nThe second type is a nonlinear transformation applied to the observations. This is typically a choice between logarithmic transform and no transformation but for modeling can be any power of the Box-Cox transformation.\n\nm_none <- seas(AirPassengers, transform.function = \"none\")\nm_log  <- seas(AirPassengers, transform.function = \"log\")"

    "text": "4.2 Additive and multiplicative adjustment\nAs you remember from Chapter 1, Seasonal adjustment decomposes a time series into a trend, a seasonal, and an irregular component. Algebraically, the fundamental identity of seasonal adjustment looks like this:\n\\[Y_t = T_t + S_t + I_t. \\tag{4.1}\\]\nWe seek the decompose our observed series \\(Y_t\\) into a trend \\(T_t\\), a seasonal \\(S_t\\), and an irregular \\(I_t\\) component. The formulation above is additive, i.e., the trend, the seasonal, and the irregular component sum up to the observed series. The goal of seasonal adjustment is to subtract the seasonal component:\n\\[A_t = Y_t - S_t.\\]\nFor example, an observed value of 100 with a seasonal factor of 3.2 would result in a seasonally adjusted value of 100 - 3.2 = 96.8.\nAlternatively, the decomposition can be multiplicative:\n\\[Y_t = T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot I_t \\tag{4.2}\\]\nI.e., the observed series is the product of the trend and the seasonal and irregular components. Since these are factors, the goal of seasonal adjustment is to remove seasonality by dividing by the seasonal factor.\n\\[A_t = \\frac{Y_t}{S_t}.\\]\nFor example, an observed value of 100 with a seasonal factor of 1.08 would result in a seasonally adjusted value of 100 / 1.08 = 92.59259. Hence for multiplicative models, values of \\(S_t > 1\\) decrease the observed value, and \\(S_t < 1\\) increase it. Keep this in mind when viewing seasonal factors such as in the function monthplot(m).\nFor a multiplicative adjustment, it is sufficient to take logarithms of the initial series and re-transform the results after the decomposition. The transform spec takes care of this."

The choice is made by comparing the AICc1 value of an ARIMA (0 1 1)(0 1 1) model fit, or a user-specified ARIMA model, to the log-transformed series and the original series.1 With small sample sizes, a standard AIC test may select models with too many parameters. AICc tackles this problem by correcting for sample size.\nFor most practical purposes, this is an effective choice and can be left to the program to decide. If your series has negative values, it can not be log-transformed, and automatic selection is performed. Other restrictions on the allowed transformations exist, but these situations are rare. We can look at the results of the transformation tests by looking at specific statistics. The udg() function provides access to a large number of diagnostical statistics.The qs() function and the AIC(), BIC() and logLik() methods are wrappers that use udg() to access some specific diagnostical statistics.\n\nm <- seas(AirPassengers)\nudg(m, c(\"aictest.trans.aicc.nolog\", \"aictest.trans.aicc.log\"))\n#> aictest.trans.aicc.nolog   aictest.trans.aicc.log \n#>                1021.1919                 987.3845\n\nWe see the AICc for log transformation is lower and hence selected.

With no transformation, X-13 will perform an additive seasonal adjustment specified in Equation 4.1.

    "text": "5.1 SARIMA model\nAs the name implies, there are two components that one needs to understand when fitting a regARIMA model; namely regression and ARIMA. Furthermore, the ARIMA part is made up by a differencing order and the stochastic ARMA portion. In this chapter, we try to break these three components down to the most fundamental ingredients without an overly technical exposition. Essentially, providing readers with enough information about each topic to understand the rest of this book and go off and perform satisfactory seasonal adjustment. The interested reader is encouraged to find material devoted to each of these components separately to more fully understand them.\nARIMA is an acronym describing the three parts of the modeling paradigm. AR = autoregressive, I = integrated (differenced), and MA = moving average. The prefix auto or “self”, explains the AR portion perfectly. We model the current observation with lagged values from the past. This is illustrated with the classic autoregressive model of order 1:\n\\[ Y_t = \\phi Y_{t-1} + a_t \\]\nwhere \\(Y_t\\) is the observed time series, \\(\\phi\\) is a coefficient to be estimated and \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) is an uncorrelated sequence of errors similar to that of standard linear regression. This model is notated AR(1). If instead of a single lag we used \\(p\\) lags, the model would be and AR(\\(p\\)) and have structure:\n\\[ Y_t = \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\phi_p Y_{t-p} + a_t \\]\nwhere now we have \\(p\\) coefficients \\(\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_p\\) to be estimated.\nThe moving average part of ARIMA model is similar in notation and reflects the number of lagged values of the error sequence should be included. For example, an MA(1) model with coefficient parameter \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\\[ Y_t = a_t + \\theta a_{t-1} \\].\nNote that instead of doing self-regression we include past values of the unobserved errors in the model at time \\(t\\). If instead of a single lag we wanted \\(q\\) lags of the past error terms, we would have an MA(\\(q\\)) model:\n\\[ Y_t = a_t + \\theta_1 a_{t-1} + \\theta_2 a_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\theta_q a_{t-q} \\].\nWhen we combine these two ideas we can model \\(Y_t\\) with \\(p\\) lagged values of itself together with \\(q\\) lagged values of the unobserved errors. Together it makes an ARMA(\\(p\\), \\(q\\)) model, one of the fundamental ingredients to the regARIMA model. For a practitioner the automatic modeling done in X13 is often sufficient to find an appropriate value for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and hence a well fitting ARMA model. If it more important from a seasonal adjustment perspective to correctly specify the differencing and regression variables in your overall regARIMA model."

    "text": "5.2 Differencing\nARMA models work best for stationary time series. This means the mean does not depend on time (such as increasing trend) or have a correlation structure that changes. Many techniques could be used to take a non-stationary time series and transform it to stationarity, one ubiquitous method is differencing. There is a famous results that states if you difference your series \\(k\\) times it will remove a polynomial trend of degree \\(k\\). Essentially, if you observe a time series with a linear trend then first differencing will remove the trend. If a time series has quadratic trend (polynomial of order 2) then differencing twice will remove that trend. A similar phenomenon can happen at seasonal lags and often a time series will also require seasonal differencing to reduce it to stationary. The order of differencing, also called the intgreation order, for the non-seaosnal and seasonal parts of our model are usually notated as \\(d\\) and \\(D\\) respectively. When we bring the integration order together with the stocastic model specification we have the notation \\[\\text{SARIMA}\\underbrace{(p, d, q)}_{\\text{non-seasonal }}\\underbrace{(P, D, Q)}_{\\text{seasonal}}.\\] This can be seen easily with an example. Consider the log transformed AirPassengers series.\n\nplot(log(AirPassengers))\n\n\n\n\nWe see a clear increasing trend and seasonal pattern. Let’s call the observed series \\(X_t\\). We can difference the series to make \\(Y_t = \\Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}\\). A plot of \\(Y_t\\) looks like\n\nplot(diff(log(AirPassengers)))\n\n\n\n\nThe trend has been removed however some seasonal trend (strong seasonal patterns) still exist. Apply seasonal differencing to the already first differenced series \\(Y_t\\):\n\\[ Z_t = Y_t - Y_{t-12} \\]\nA plot of \\(Z_t\\):\n\nplot(diff(diff(log(AirPassengers)), 12))\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that both the original linear trend and seasonal pattern are removed and what is left is a stationary process that can adequately be modeled with an SARMA(0, 1)(0, 1) model. When you bring in the integration (differencing) order of one for the seasonal and non-seasonal components, we are left with the model named after this exact time series! The so called ``airline model’’ is the SARIMA(0, 1, 1)(0, 1, 1) and the terminology came to popularity via Box and Jenkins, “Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control” textbook."

Recall that earlier it was mentioned that using automatic model identification is sufficient for most to get an adequate seasonal adjustment. Hence, this is simply for the interested reader to begin to gain additional intuition into the stochastic structures involved in their series and the types of structures the automatic modeling procedures look at. One of the main tools in a time series analyist tool box is the autocorrelation function (ACF). This is a function that returns the correlation between observations \\(h\\) time units apart throughout the entire sample. So for \\(h=2\\) this means looking at the correlation between the pairs \\((X_1, X_3), (X_2, X_4), (X_3, X_5), \\ldots\\). Then a way to build a SARIMA model is to match the sample ACF and the theoretical ACF of a given model. The main point distinguishing an AR(\\(p\\)) and MA(\\(q\\)) is how their theoretical ACF behaves. An AR(\\(p\\)) will have ACF the has exponential decay as \\(h\\) increases. For example, an AR(1) ACF is \\[\\rho(h) = \\phi^h\\] An MA(\\(q\\)) models ACF will be non-zero for the first \\(q\\) lags and then cutoff to zero thereafter. The ACF of an MA(1) is \\[\\rho(h) = \\begin{cases}\n~~1 & h = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\theta}{1 + \\theta^2} & h = 1 \\\\\n~~0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] In practice of course the difference between decay and cut-off can be nebulous to detect but the interested reader is encouraged to explore the arima.sim() function the look at the sample ACF with the acf() function. As you increase the sample size it will converge to the theoretical ACF value and you can start to see the structures just discussed.\n\nx_AR <- arima.sim(model = list(ar = .75), n = 300)\nx_MA <- arima.sim(model = list(ma = .75), n = 300)\ntsbox::ts_plot(cbind(x_AR, x_MA))\nop <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 2, 4, 2))\nacf(x_AR, xlab = \"h\", main = \"\"); title(\"ACF of AR(1) model\")\nacf(x_MA, xlab = \"h\", main = \"\"); title(\"ACF of MA(1) model\")\npar <- op"

    "text": "5.4 Regression\nWe have discussed SARIMA modeling (both the SARMA and differencing), now we see how exogenous regression variables come into play.\nThe regARIMA model takes the form \\[ f\\left(\\frac{Y_t}{D_t} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\prime {\\mathbf X}_t + Z_t .\\] Here \\(Y_t\\) is the observed time series. The function \\(f\\) represents a transformation, most commonly used is the log transform ie \\(f(x) = \\log(x)\\). \\(D_t\\) is any intervention that has taken place prior to any transformation or modeling. This intervention is usually subjective and customized for individual series on an as-needed basis. For example, if a soybean farmer strike occurred and the soybean export series suffered for its duration. This type of event might adversely affect the seasonal adjustment filters and automatic model identification routines and can be mediated as an initial step. If no transformation or intervention is needed the model form is: \\[ Y_t = \\underbrace{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\prime {\\mathbf X}_t}_{\\text{Regression}} + \\underbrace{Z_t}_{\\text{ARIMA}} .\\]\nThe regression variables appear in the columns of the design matrix \\({\\mathbf X}_t\\) and \\(Z_t\\) is an ARIMA process. This last assumption on \\(Z_t\\) is what distinguished a regARIMA model from more classic linear models and multiple linear regression where error terms are assumed uncorrelated.\nIn order to achieve a suitable seasonal adjustment it is important to get the regARIMA model correct. For most dataset the built in automatic modeling features of the X13 program will be suitable to detect a reasonable model. This can be used as a starting point for more rigorous regARIMA model development or used as the final regARIMA modeling choice for your seasonal adjustment needs. We evoke automatic model identification through the XXX spec.

As we have seen in Section 4.2, we write the fundamental identity as:\n\\[\nX_t = T_t + S_t + I_t\n\\]\nwhere, \\(X_t\\) is the observed time series, \\(T_t\\) the trend, \\(S_t\\) the seasonal component and \\(I_t\\) the irregular component. Once the decomposition is done, the seasonally adjusted series for an additive1 decomposition can be computed as:\nFor a multiplicative decomposition, the fundamental identity is\n\\[\nX_t = T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot I_t\n\\]\nand the adjusted series is:\n\\[\nA_t = \\frac{X_t}{S_t}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA_t = X_t - S_t\n\\]\nHow to perform the seasonal decomposition? Ultimately, both X-11 and SEATS estimate the components \\(T_t\\), \\(S_t\\), \\(I_t\\) by passing moving average filters over the series. In order to get unbiased results at the margin, the underlying series is usually extended by forecasts from the regARIMA model discussed in the Chapter 5. This regARIMA model also serves as the foundation of the initial steps in the X11 algorithm to remove outliers and other regression effects before application of moving-averages.\nHow do we apply moving average filters over a series? The trend component can be estimated by applying a moving average over the observed series. For each point in time, an simple average that uses a certain number of observations both on the left and the right of the series. Because the window is symmetric, we need the series extended by forecasts and backcasts.\nOnce the trend component is computed, we can subtract it from the original series to compute a detrended series."

A basic trend filter could be a simple 2x12 moving average. This filter has weights 1/24, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12, 1/24.

The most obvious thing we see in this plot is the last of seasonal adjustment at the ends of the series. Hence, why we need to use regARIMA modeling to forecast extend. Additionally, we see some obvious flaws this this adjustment. It is difficult to estimate a trend in the presence of seasonality. Similarly, it is difficult to estimate the seasonal factors when the trend is poorly estimated/removed.\nThis motivates the X-11 method which is an iterative application of this simple procedure we have just performed. Each subsequent iteration allows the estimated components to be refined by selecting better filters and handling extreme values and regression effects. The first adaptation is to consider a transformation of our series from AirPassengers to log(AirPassengers). Our simple example performed an additive seasonal adjustment. This transformation will require a move to a multiplicative decomposition."

A variant of the simple decomposition performed in Section Section 6.2 is run 3 times along with a pre-processing step to fit a regARIMA model. This procedure can be seen in great detail in Ladiray and Quenneville (2012). The overview of each step:\n\nLadiray, Dominique, and Benoit Quenneville. 2012. Seasonal Adjustment with the x-11 Method.

In X-13, these refer to very different types of effects. An outlier is identified by the regARIMA model in Part A of the X-11 method. An extreme value is a value that is large enough to effect the results of a moving-average filter but is not identified by the regARIMA automatic modeling identification. Outliers are prior-adjusted out of the series while extreme values are replaced within the X-11 procedure.\nBoth types end up in the seasonally adjusted series. Extreme values are assigned to the irregular component and are hence included in the seasonally adjusted series. Outliers get included in Part D when X-11 calculates the final seasonal factors using the original series including outlier effects.\n\n\nDuring these steps the trend filter is automatically chosen based the noise-to-signal ratios, labeled I/C in the output file.

    "text": "6.4 Frequency domain of time series (optional)\nWe present the following as optional reading material. For those interesting in simply performing seasonal adjustment, an understanding of the frequency domain of a time series, is not mandatory. However, the spectral domain representation will help the interested reader further understand the impact a linear filter has on a time series. Since both X-11 and SEATS use linear filters this will deepen the users understanding of whichever seasonal adjustment procedure is chosen.\nSeasonal adjustment is highly motivated by the study, estimation, and ultimately removal of regular fluctuations in a time series. The words regular fluctuations immediately leads us to trigonometric functions sine and cosine. It turns out, there exist two equivalent representations of a time series. The first, and usually easier for beginners to understand, is the time domain representation. This is expressing how \\(X_t\\) evolves as time \\(t\\) evolves. For example, an MA(1) time domain representation:\n\\[X_t = w_t + \\theta w_{t-1}\\]\nThe second, is a frequency domain representation of a series. Here, \\(X_t\\) is represented as the sum of trigonometric functions. More specifically, the spectral density of \\(X_t\\) is the fourier transform of the acf of the series. \\[f_X(\\nu) = \\sum_{h = - \\infty}^{\\infty} \\gamma(h) e^{-2\\pi i \\nu h}\\] For example, the spectral density of an MA(1) is: \\[f_X(\\nu) = \\sigma^2 \\left( 1 + \\theta^2 + 2\\theta\\cos(2\\pi\\nu) \\right)\\]\nThe important concept here is to understand that these representations are equivalent; meaning they contain the same information about a time series, such as encoding the acf function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere does the term “White Noise” come from?\n\n\n\nThe spectral density of an uncorrelated sequence with variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is simply \\(f(\\nu) = \\sigma^2\\). Notice this is not a function of any frequencies but just a constant for any \\(\\nu\\). Hence, it is a stochastic process that equally weight all frequencies in the spectrum. This is precisely where the names white noise comes from as white light has the same property of reflecting all color bands equally, combining to produce white light.\n\n\nNow that we know we can express a time series either in the time domain or as a sum of sin and cosine curves, we get to the important part for seasonal adjustment - how does a linear filter effect the input series? Assume we want to pass a moving-average linear filter over our data \\(X_t\\) with weights \\(\\ldots, w_{-2}, w_{-1}, w_{0}, w_{1}, w_{2}, \\ldots\\). Assume the output of the linear filter will be \\(Y_t\\) such that \\[Y_t = \\sum_{j = -\\infty}^{\\infty} w_j X_{t+j} =\n\\ldots + w_{-2}X_{t-2} + w_{-1}X_{t-1} +  w_{0}X_{t} + w_{1}X_{t+1} + w_{2}X_{t+2} + \\ldots\\] This type of linear filter can be expressed as a linear operator in terms of the backshift operator \\(B\\) , where \\(BX_t = X_{t-1}\\) and \\(B^{-1}X_t = X_{t+1}\\). \\[W(B) = \\ldots + w_{-2}B^2 + w_{-1}B +  w_{0} + w_{1}B^{-1} + w_{2}B^{-2} + \\ldots\\] and hence \\(Y_t = W(B)X_t\\). We can now express the spectral density of \\(Y_t\\) in terms of the input spectral density \\(X_t\\). \\[f_Y(\\nu) = \\underbrace{\\lvert W(e^{2\\pi i \\nu}) \\rvert^2}_{\\text{Square Gain Function}} f_X(\\nu)\\]\nThere is some mathematical machinery needed when understanding exactly what the square-gain function, \\(\\lvert W(e^{2\\pi i \\nu}) \\rvert^2\\), is. However, for the sake of this text we just know that it tells us exactly the frequencies of \\(X_t\\) that amplified in the output \\(Y_t\\) as well as the frequencies of \\(X_t\\) that will be annihilated (when the square-gain function equals 0).\nLet’s look at an example spectrum for the airline model. Instead of deriving the result, the following code simulates observations from an airline model with \\(\\theta = .5\\) and \\(\\Theta = .9\\). The spectrum is then estimated using a parametric estimator using the spec.ar function.

The X-11 spec also allows users to control the length of the trend and seasonal moving average filters used during the adjustment. Generally speaking, longer filters imply a more stable seasonal component and shorter filters a more changing seasonal pattern. Of course, a longer filter will use more data for the calculation of components at each time point. This is an important observation and understanding it might help a user decide on a short or long filter. Since longer filters use more data there tend to be smaller revisions when a new data point is added. However, there will be revisions to data values further back.\nA shorter filter is just the opposite, they tend to produce larger revisions but they do not extend as far back into the series. If a filter is not choosen by the user then automatic filter selection is used. To understand the length of a filter let’s look at the (finite) number of choice available in during an x11 adjustment.

This can be changed in the mode argument of the x11 spec. For example, seas(x, x11.mode = 'add') will perform an additive x11 run. There exist two other models for decomposition, pseudo-additive and log additive. These are less common than additive and multiplicative models and are not the focus of this text.

    "text": "7.1 Model based decomposition\nSignal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series, or SEATS, is a method for estimating unobserved components in a time series. It is developed from the work of Cleveland and Tiao (1976), Hillmer and Tiao (1982), Maravall (1986). If applied properly, SEATS seasonal factors are usually more stable than X-11, and the seasonally adjusted series show less revisions than X11 (see Section 7.10 for a more extensive discussion).\n\nCleveland, William P, and George C Tiao. 1976. “Decomposition of Seasonal Time Series: A Model for the Census x-11 Program.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 71 (355): 581–87.\n\nHillmer, S. C., and G. C. Tiao. 1982. “An ARIMA-Model-Based Approach to Seasonal Adjustment.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 77 (377): 63–70. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2287770.\n\nMaravall, Agustin. 1986. “Revisions in ARIMA Signal Extraction.” Journal of the American Statistical Association 81 (395): 736–40. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2289005.\nLike X-11, SEATS applies a series of filters to an observed time series, as described in Section 6.1. Like X-11, SEATS uses a forecast extended series, in order to obtain unbiased results at the margin.\nUnlike X-11, however, SEATS filters are derived from the ARIMA model of the time series. While X-11 filters are predefined and fixed, the SEATS filters are different for each ARIMA model.\nWhile X-11 offers a finite set of filters (in fact, there are seven seasonal filters available), SEATS offers an infinte set of filters. Overall, they cover a broader set of possilbe filter lengths, which makes SEATS a more flexilble option than X-11. The available set filter lengths is the most crucial difference between X-11 and SEATS. At the same time, the additional flexibility may lead at times to filters that are undedesirable. As will be shown later on, SEATS sometimes choose a filter that is too narrow, and produces an overly volatile seasonal component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing X-11 and SEATS filters\n\n\n\nX-11 filters\n\nfinite set of empirically developed moving average filters\nfixed filtering seen as easier to use (less statistical machinery)\nSEATS filters\n\nspecifies stochastic models for unobserved components\nderives seasonal adjustment filters from these models\ninfinite number of possible filter choices\nrequires more statistical machinery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\nPlots of X-11 filters vs SEATS filters\n\n\nGiven a certain ARIMA model (such as the “Airline” (0 1 1)(0 1 1) model which is appropriate for the description of the AirPassengers time series), SEATS decomposes the model into separate models for the trend, the seasonal and the irregular component. This is done by the Canonical Decomposition and will be discussed in Section 7.6.\nThe decomposition of the ARIMA model is almost independent of the data. For each ARIMA specification, there is a unique canonical decomposition. For a normal “Airline” (0 1 1)(0 1 1) model (with both moving average coefficients not being to close to 1), the trend component can be described with a (0 2 2)(0 0 0) model, while the seasonal component can be described approximately by a (0 0 11)(0 0 0) model. The parameters of these models can be derived from the parameter estimations of the initial airline model that describes the original series. The irregular component is usually white noise, described by the trivial (0 0 0)(0 0 0) model.\nThe decomposed ARIMA models imply a certain filter, which is derived by the Wiener-Kolmogorov procedure (Section 7.7)."

    "text": "7.2 Comparing SEATS with X-11 filters\nIf SEATS and X-11 use similar filters, the final adjustment will be similar. Using the default arguments of seas() on AirPassengers, the adjustment is very similar:\n\nseats <- seas(AirPassengers)\nx11 <- seas(AirPassengers, x11 = list())\ntsbox::ts_plot(final(seats), final(x11))\n\n\n\n\nOthers have looked at comparing SEATS and X-11 filters. In Planas and Depoutot (2002) they show with X11 seasonal filter that is closest to an implied (0 1 1)(0 1 1) “Airline” SEATS model based on the \\(\\Theta_{12}\\). As a reminder, \\(\\Theta_{12}\\) refers to the moving average parameter of the seasonal difference in the ARIMA model.\n\nPlanas, Christophe, and Raoul Depoutot. 2002. “Controlling Revisions in Arima-Model-Based Seasonal Adjustment.” Journal of Time Series Analysis 23 (2): 193–213.\n\n\nFilter\nClosest Seasonal MA\nSeasonal MA Interval\n\n\n\n3x3\n0.364 - 0.400\n0.0 - 0.5\n\n\n3x5\n0.543 - 0.563\n0.51 - 0.74\n\n\n3x9\n0.723 - 0.732\n0.75 - 0.87\n\n\n3x15\n0.824 - 0.828\n0.88 - 1.00\n\n\n\nLet’s consider small vs large values of seasonal \\(\\Theta_{12}\\). Values of \\(\\Theta\\) close to zero yield a seasonal adjustment filter that has seasonal factors that change rapidly over time. This provides considerable smoothing and large revisions. These revisions will only last for a small number of years due to the shorter filters.\nValues of \\(\\Theta\\) close to one yield a seasonal adjustment filter that has seasonal factors that change slowly over time. This provides less smoothing but relatively small revisions. Any revisions that do occur will last for a longer period of time due to the longer filters.\nOverall, we may think of SEATS filters as a broader, more flexible set of filters than X-11 filers. While we have just seven filters in X-11, we have an infite numer of filters in SEATS. They cover a larger range of filters spans, ranging from filters that are much narrower than X-11 to filters that are much wider.\nSEATS greatest stength is also its greatest weakness. As we will see in the example below, SEATS sometimes chooses a filter that is very narrow. From a SEATS perspective, this makes sense: Given an ARIMA model with a very weak seasonality, the filter lengths should be chooses narrowly. From a practical perspective, the resulting seasonal component is undesirable. It is too volatile, essentially catching much of the irregular component and making the resulting seasonally adjusted series too smooth."

The examined a cross section of 87 BLS series with X-11, SEATS, and STAMP using spectral, revisions history, model adequacy and sliding spans diagnostics. They found that SEATS seasonal factors are usually more stable than X-11 and X-11 trend component is usually more stable than SEATS. Also, among series that were seasonal, residual seasonality almost never appears using either method.\nThe only exception being a small number of SEATS runs where model inadequacy for the full span of data was present. This manifested as SEATS having difficulty identifying a usable model for decomposition and falling back on the airline model. They found even in these situations the SEATS seasonal adjustment is usually reasonable.\nOverall, X-11 and SEATS seasonal adjustments are very similar for many series. SEATS adjustments are often smoother than X-11 seasonal adjustments. For some series, the variance can be different based on the month or season. For example, U.S. Housing Starts is more variable in the winter months than in the summer due to the differences in warm and cold winters. ARIMA model-based seasonal adjustment does not handle this situation very well and assumes a constant variance and the SEATS adjustment wont compensate for this.\n\n7.10.1 Reasons for using SEATS or X11 (Work in progress)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO\n\n\n\nAdd Table with pros and cons\n\n\n\nWhen applied properly (good ARIMA model, filters are not too narrow), it produces a seasonal component that is more stable.

The Chinese New Year is celebrated either in January or in February of the Gregorian calendar.\nBecause of its importance, Chinese New Year seriously distorts monthly time series, which are usually reported according to the Gregorian calendar. Unlike Easter, Chinese New Year does not affect quarterly time series, as it always falls in the first quarter.\nX-13-ARIMA-SEATS has a built-in adjustment procedure for Easter holiday, but not for Chinese New Year. However, all packages allow for the inclusion of user-defined variables, and the Chinese New Year can be modeled as such.\nWith the R package seasonal, generating and including such a series is easy. We will use it in the following to seasonally adjust and remove Chinese New Year effects from the nominal dollar value of imports to China. seasonal is an interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS; for more information and installation details, see here.\n\n8.3.1 Imports of Goods to China\nChinese imports are included as an example series in seasonal, both with and without the official seasonal adjustment.\n\nlibrary(tsbox)\nts_plot(imp_cn)\n\n\n\n\nThe series has a very different seasonal pattern before 2000, we focus on the later period. (Adjusting the whole series in one step is possible, but for good results one should manually model the seasonal break.)\n\nimp_cn_2000 <- ts_span(imp_cn, start = 2000)\n\nts_dygraphs() works similar to ts_plot(), but allows for zooming:\n\nts_dygraphs(imp_cn_2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to read data from FRED into R\n\n\n\n{fredr} provides access to the Federal Reserve of Economic Data (FRED), provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. To use fredr and the FRED API in general, you must first obtain a FRED API key. Have a look at the Documentation for details.\nThe core function in this package is fredr(), which fetches observations for a FRED series.\nWe can use purrr::map_dfr() to download multiple series at once:\n\nlibrary(fredr)\nimp_cn_raw <- purrr::map_dfr(c(\"XTIMVA01CNM667S\", \"XTIMVA01CNM667N\"), fredr)\n\nA bit of tidying:\n\nimp_cn_tidy <-\n  imp_cn_raw %>%\n  select(time = date, id = series_id, value) %>%\n  mutate(id = recode(\n    id,\n    XTIMVA01CNM667S = \"sa\",\n    XTIMVA01CNM667N = \"nsa\"\n  ))\n\nUse the tsbox package to convert the data frame into ts objects.\n\nlibrary(tsbox)\nimp_cn_sa <- ts_ts(ts_pick(imp_cn_tidy, \"sa\"))\nimp_cn <- ts_ts(ts_pick(imp_cn_tidy, \"nsa\"))\n\nBoth time series are included in the book package.\n\nlibrary(seasonalbook)\nimp_cn_sa\nimp_cn\n\n\n\nseasonal includes the genhol() function, a R version of the equally named software utility by the U.S. Census Bureau. Using the dates of the Chinese New Year as an input, it produces a time series with the deviations from the monthly means. Here we are assuming that the holiday starts on New Year’s Eve and lasts for one week.\n\nreg_cny <- genhol(cny, start = -1, end = 6, center = \"calendar\")\ntsbox::ts_dygraphs(reg_cny)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Including user-defined regressors\nThe time series reg_cny can be included in the main seasonal adjustment. The automated procedures of X-13ARIMA-SEATS can be applied to the imp series in the following way:\n\nm1 <- seas(\n  imp_cn,\n  xreg = reg_cny,\n  regression.usertype = \"holiday\",\n  x11 = list()\n)\nsummary(m1)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> seas(x = imp_cn, xreg = reg_cny, regression.usertype = \"holiday\", \n#>     x11 = list())\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>                     Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    \n#> xreg              -0.1765307  0.0126609 -13.943  < 2e-16 ***\n#> Weekday            0.0074007  0.0009128   8.108 5.16e-16 ***\n#> AO1999.Dec        -0.2067229  0.0505932  -4.086 4.39e-05 ***\n#> LS2008.Nov        -0.3893238  0.0529569  -7.352 1.96e-13 ***\n#> MA-Nonseasonal-01  0.4519761  0.0471994   9.576  < 2e-16 ***\n#> MA-Seasonal-12     0.3140128  0.0486579   6.453 1.09e-10 ***\n#> ---\n#> Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n#> \n#> X11 adj.

We also have chosen X11 as the decomposition method.\nUnsurprisingly, the summary reveals a highly significant Chinese New Year effect. As the automatic model has been estimated on the logarithmic series, the coefficient of -0.17 indicates that New Year in 2023 will lower imports in January, by approximately 0.74 * 17 ~ 13% (compared to average January), and increase it by the same amount in February. The automatic procedure has also detected weekday effects and a level shift during the financial crisis.\n\n8.3.3 Multiple regressors\nWe can do even better by using more than one user-defined regressors, one for the pre-New-Year period and one for the post-New-Year period:\n\npre_cny <- genhol(cny, start = -6, end = -1, frequency = 12, center = \"calendar\")\npost_cny <- genhol(cny, start = 0, end = 6, frequency = 12, center = \"calendar\")\nm2 <- seas(\n  imp_cn,\n  xreg = ts_c(pre_cny, post_cny),\n  regression.usertype = \"holiday\",\n  x11 = list()\n)\nsummary(m2)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> seas(x = imp_cn, xreg = ts_c(pre_cny, post_cny), regression.usertype = \"holiday\", \n#>     x11 = list())\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>                     Estimate Std.

Our models (both m1, but especially m2), does a much better job of adjusting to Chinese New Year.\n\nts_dygraphs(\n  ts_c(\n    cny = ts_span(reg_cny * 1e11 + 1e11, start = 2000, end = 2024),\n    ts_pick(imp_cn_2000, \"sa\"),\n    final(seas(x = imp_cn, x11 = \"\")),\n    final(m2)\n  )\n)"

    "text": "You are reading an early draft of Seasonal Adjustment in R. This chapter is currently a dumping ground for ideas, and we don’t recommend reading it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.0.1 Introduction\nExceptional data value, or outliers may constitute a problem both for the ARIMA model building as well as for the sesonal filtering. When analyzing time series data, outlier values are common. In some cases, these issues can be linked to actual events in the real world, such as:\n\nthe COVID-19 pandamemic\nthe 2008/09 financial market crash\nNatural disasters\nUkraine crisis\n\nThese events can impact the accuracy of seasonal adjustment. As a result, X-13 tries to remove these inconsistencies before performing seasonal adjustment.\nX-13 offers several ways to model outliers. In this chapter, we will focus on two most important types of effects that can occur in time series data: level shifts and additive outliers. By understanding these effects and how to address them, analysts can improve the quality of their analyses and draw more accurate conclusions from the data.\n\n10.0.2 Level Shift\nThe first outlier category we look at are level shifts. Level shifts refers to a sudden and sustained change in the underlying level of a time series. Theree can be various causes of level shifts in time series data, such as changes in concepts or definitions of the survey population, alterations in the method of data collection, shifts in economic behavior, changes in legislation, etc. Below is an example of a level shift:\nTODO\nLevel shifts are a problem for seasonal adjustment because they will distort the estimation of the seasonal factors.\nWithin X-13, the initial trend is calculated by applying a moving average to the series. If there is an abrupt change in the level of the series, the estimates will be distorted. The estimates before the level shift will be underestimated, and those after will be overestimated. As the calculation of the irregular and seasonal components follow on from this initial trend-cycle estimation, they may be distorted as well.\nTODO explain example\n\n10.0.3 Level Shift\nThe first outlier category we look at are level shifts. Level shifts refers to a sudden and sustained change in the underlying level of a time series. Theree can be various causes of level shifts in time series data, such as changes in concepts or definitions of the survey population, alterations in the method of data collection, shifts in economic behavior, changes in legislation, etc. Below is an example of a level shift:\nTODO\nLevel shifts are a problem for seasonal adjustment because they will distort the estimation of the seasonal factors.\nWithin X-13, the initial trend is calculated by applying a moving average to the series.

As the calculation of the irregular and seasonal components follow on from this initial trend-cycle estimation, they may be distorted as well.\nTODO explain example\n\n10.0.4 Additive Outliers\nAn additive outlier is a data point that falls outside the general pattern of the trend and seasonal component in a time series. Outliers can be caused by random effects, such as an extreme irregular point, or by identifiable factors, such as a strike or bad weather.\nAdditive outliers pose a significant challenge to seasonal adjustment methods, which rely on moving averages. The crux of the problem lies in the inherent sensitivity of averages to the presence of extreme values or outliers. When unusual data points are included, the average can become unrepresentative of the underlying pattern in the series. Without proper adjustments or allowances for outliers, estimates for all the components in a time series can become distorted. As such, addressing additive outliers is critical to maintaining the integrity of seasonal adjustment techniques and ensuring accurate analyses.\nTODO example\nSeasonally adjusting the data above, without allowing for the outliers, gives the following results:\nTODO\n\n10.0.5 Identifiying Outliers\nX-13 contains an outomated outlier detection procedure that works well in most circumstances and can be used as a starting poing. Plotting the series may add additional information on wheter outliers should be adjusted or not.\nTODO\nseries{title=“Example of level shift and outlier search” start=1994.1 period=4 file=“mydata.txt”} arima{model=(0,1,1)(0,1,1)} outlier{types=(ao ls) span=(2002.2, ) x11{mode=mult}\nThe outlier specification in the arima model allows for automatic detection of level shifts and additive outliers, either individually or in combination. Once identified, the outliers are incorporated into the model as “Automatically Identified Outliers” along with appropriate regression variables.\nIt’s important to note that this specification has some limitations. Specifically, it can only detect outliers with a high critical value for their t-statistics. The critical value used depends on the number of observations searched for outliers. For instance, if the search is conducted for the last year of data, the critical value is 3.16, which is higher than the standard critical value of 1.96. Consequently, outliers with t-statistics between 1.96 and 3.16 may not be detected with this option.\nTherefore, it’s crucial to conduct visual checks of the NSA and SA series to identify any outliers that might have been missed by the automatic detection process. For more information on the default critical values for outlier identification, refer to the X-13 Reference Manual.\n\n10.0.6 Additional tools to identify outliers\nIdenfifying level shifts and additive outliers is no always as obvious as in the example above. The following tables may help to identify the level shifts and additive outliers\nTODO (From ONS Manual)\n\nLook at Table E5 and E6 in the output? These tables show the month- on-month (or quarter-on-quarter) changes in the original and seasonally adjusted estimates. In fact, a level shift will appear as a sudden large increase which is not followed by a corresponding decrease (or vice versa) in Table E5 and E6. The adjustment for the level shift effectively attempts to remove this sudden change in the level.\nAdditive outliers can be detected by analysing Table C17 and D13 in addition to Table E5 and E6 in the output. In fact, an additive outlier will appear as one or more zeros in the period of the outlier in Table C17, which gives the final weights for the irregular component, and as a residual pattern of the irregular component presented in Table D13. In addition to inspecting these four output tables, M1, M2 and M3 statistics should be checked. M1, M2 and M3 each measure the level of the irregular component in the series compared to the trend and the seasonal components. If these fail it may indicate that outliers need to be replaced as temporary prior adjustments.\n\n10.0.7 Confirming the reason for the level shifts or the additive outliers\nTODO (From ONS Manual)\nIf the X-12-ARIMA test and the graphs of the NSA and SA series lead you to suspect a level shift or an outlier, then check which months/quarters it appears in. Question if there is any evidence for suspecting a level shift or outlier at this time point. If there is not a methodological, social or economic reason to explain the presence of the suspected level shift or outlier then do not adjust for it."

If a series is not seasonal, the resulting series may be bad.\nFortunatly, X-13 contains a few tests that help users to decide if a series is is seasnal or not.\nBefore appying X-13AS ist may be necessary to descide if the series is seasonal.\n\n12.0.1 Avalabele Tests\nX13 offers has several formal checks:\n\nqs test\nids\nm7\n\nThe ids test is closely connected to m7, but the QS test is quite different.

In particular, one of the following statements will always appear:\n\nIDENTIFIABLE SEASONALITY PRESENT\nIDENTIFIABLE SEASONALITY PROBABLY NOT PRESEN\nIDENTIFIABLE SEASONALITY NOT PRESENT\n\nIt is recommended that a series is adjusted in the first two cases and not adjusted in the last one. However there are two cases where one might need to deviate from this practice:\n\nThis is the ids test shown below\n\n12.0.3 Case Study"
