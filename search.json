    "text": "Seasonal Adjustment\nMany time series exhibit a regular seasonal pattern over the year. US unemployment, for example, is usually higher from January to March and again in June and July. Similarly, retail sales tend to peak during the Christmas season. This seasonal behavior is regular and predictable. The goal of seasonal adjustment is to estimate and remove the seasonal component from a time series.\nWhy do we want to do this? Seasonal data is usually hard to interpret. For example, if we want to learn from the US unemployment rate if the economy is moving out of a recession during certain months, we want the labor market data to be free from seasonal effects."

    "text": "X-13ARIMA-SEATS\nFundamentally, seasonal adjustment decomposes a time series into a trend, a seasonal, and an irregular component. Seasonal adjustment is then the act of removing the seasonal estimate from the observed series. There are many ways to perform this decomposition. This book focuses on a particular one, X-13ARIMA-SEATS (X-13, for short), the seasonal adjustment software developed by the United States Census Bureau. X-13 offers an elaborate toolkit to perform seasonal adjustment. The software allows users to control all aspects of the modeling process or alternatively, to use automated methods to make all modeling choices. In the text we will try to present material with this in mind. Throughout we offer suggestions about when built-in automatic method are sufficient (and sometimes even preferred) and when an analyst can get the most ``bang for the buck’’ to control modeling options themselves."

It should be noted that the seasonal package is not a re-coding of the X-13 software. Instead it is a translation from R to the X-13 software. This translation is done under the hood and practitioners need not concern themselves with this inner working of the package. However, we make this point such that users understand that conceptually anything that can be done in the native X-13ARIMA-SEATS software, either from the command line or HTML version, can be done in the seasonal R package. Also this means if additional clarification or information about seasonal adjustment is desired, the X-13 manual or research papers can be consulted. Any example or methods found via the X-13 documentation can be easily translated to the R seasonal package. In fact, all examples from the X-13 manual can be seen run in the R seasonal package at http://www.seasonal.website/examples.html. The required X-13 binaries are provided by the x13binary package and automatically included in seasonal. The next chapter provides a minimal example to get you started in less than five minutes."

The US Census Bureau developed the original X-11 software in the 1960s, Statistics Canada (Dagum 1980) continued the development afterward. The following software packages by the US Census Bureau were called X-12-ARIMA (Findley et al. 1998) and X-13ARIMA-SEATS (or X-13, for short) (Monsell 2007). X-11 is still used as a name for filter-based seasonal adjustment methods within X-13.

    "text": "2.2 A minimal example\nOnce the package is installed, you can load it in the usual way:\n\nlibrary(seasonal)\n\nThe seas() function provides the core functionality of the package. By default, seas calls the automatic procedures of X-13 to perform a seasonal adjustment that works well in most circumstances:\n\nseas(AirPassengers)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> seas(x = AirPassengers)\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>           Weekday          Easter[1]         AO1951.May  MA-Nonseasonal-01  \n#>          -0.00295            0.01777            0.10016            0.11562  \n#>    MA-Seasonal-12  \n#>           0.49736\n\nThe first argument of seas is a time series of class ts. ts objects are frequently used in base R and are useful to store monthly, quarterly, or annual data. We restrict our attention to monthly and quarterly series. This is done for two reasons; first is these are the main frequencies handled by X-13, second, this sampling frequency make conceptual understanding of statistical methods, such as linear filters, easier to grasp. The AirPassengers example series is included in base R and shows monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. seas() returns a seas object that contains the necessary information on the adjustment performed on this time series; we can assign it to a variable:\n\nm <- seas(AirPassengers)\n\nThere are several functions and methods for \"seas\" objects. The final function returns the adjusted series. The plot method shows a plot with the unadjusted and the adjusted series.\n\nplot(m)\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the adjusted series is much less volatile than the original one because the seasonal component was removed from the original series. But the adjusted series is not entirely smooth. This is because it still contains the irregular component.\nThis constitutes a crucial point about seasonal adjustment: It only removes regular, predictable movements, not irregular ones. In the adjusted series, we can see a decrease in airline passengers in 1953 and between 1957 and 1958. These decreases were difficult to discover in the original series.\nThe summary method displays an overview of the model, very similar to the one produced by other R classes (eg lm or numeric):\n\nsummary(m)\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> seas(x = AirPassengers)\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>                     Estimate Std.

    "text": "2.3 Where to go from here\nseas(AirPassengers) produces a good seasonal adjustment of the airline passengers time series. If you are very new to seasonal adjustment, the automated routines of X-13 and seasonal produce an adjustment that works well in most circumstances.\nThe command seas(AirPassengers) has invoked a large number of specs of X-13. spec is X-13 slang for a module within the software. X-13 is built on top of twenty specs that perform various subtasks of seasonal adjustment. Some specs are required most of the time (e.g., regression), while others are optional (e.g., seats) or purely technical (e.g., spans shortens the time series in use). Chapter 3 discusses the available specs in more detail.\nThis book teaches you how to use and fine-tune the individual specs and deal with concrete data problems.\n\n2.3.1 Fundamentals\nSpecifically, the command seas(unemp) has invoked the following fundamental specs – they are involved in most adjustments and are covered in the first part of the book:\n\nTransform\n\nA decision on initial transformation was made. The automated procedures concluded that a log transformation was made and a multiplicative seasonal adjustment model, rather than an additive model, was estimated. Chapter 4 discusses the choices. Since transform is a relatively simple spec, it is a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the spec idea.\n\nRegression\n\nAn automated model search concluded that AirPassengers is best modeled by an (0 1 1)(0 1 1) ARIMA model. Chapter 5 explains what that means and how such a model structure is determined and estimated.\n\nSEATS / X11\n\nSeasonal decomposition is performed by SEATS. SEATS is one of the two options for decomposing a series and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6. The alternative, X11, is discussed in Chapter 7.\n\n\n2.3.2 Data issues\nThe command seas(AirPassengers) has also dealt with various data issues, which are covered in the second part of the book:\n\nHoliday\n\nSignificant Easter effects have been found in AirPassengers and were removed from the adjusted series. Moving holidays like Easter or Chinese New Year are vital in seasonal adjustment since they may significantly impact the behavior of many time series. For AirPassengers, the number of passengers is higher in months with Easter. Moving holiday effects will be discussed in Chapter 8.\n\nWeekday\n\nNot every month has the same number of weekdays. Since many activities (such as air traveling) differ between weekends and weekdays, this constitutes another predictable component. In AirPassengers, there are fewer passengers on a weekday than during a weekend, and the automated procedures decided to remove the effect. These effects are discussed in Chapter 9.\n\nOutliers\n\nCertain data points may be well out of the ordinary. These outliers are a problem for the modeling and adjustment process. An automated procedure scanned the series for outliers and found an additive outlier on May 1951. This outlier is shown in the plot above, too. Outliers are discussed in Chapter 10.\n\nSeasonal Breaks\n\nThe seasonal pattern in AirPassengers looks relatively stable. Some time series, however, show abrupt changes in the seasonal pattern. Chapter 11 discusses them and shows how to deal with seasonal breaks.\n\n\n2.3.3 Additional issues\nThe third part of the book deals with additional issues:\n\nPresence of seasonality\n\nWhile the presence of seasonality in AirPassengers is prominent, this is not always the case. If a series has no seasonal pattern, there is no need for a seasonal adjustment. If it is adjusted anyway, the process adds noise to the series and should be avoided. Chapter 12 shows how seasonality can be detected and how to decide whether an adjustment should be made or not.\n\nAnnual constraining\n\nUsually, a seasonal adjustment may affect the annual values of a time series. In part, this is by design. The number of weekdays may differ between years, so the adjusted annual values may be different too. In part, this may be an artifact of the adjustment process. X-13 offers tools to enforce the annual values of the adjusted series to be the same as the original one. Chapter 13 shows how to constrain annual value and whether it is a good idea.\n\nIndirect vs. direct adjustment\n\nOften, a seasonal adjustment may be performed on individual series or on an aggregate of multiple series. X-13 offers tools that let you compare these two possibilities. Chapter 14 discusses the options and helps you to decide which one is better.\n\n\n2.3.4 Quality assessment\nAdjusting a series with the automated procedure is straightforward. But is the resulting series a reasonable adjustment? The fourth part helps you to decide between competing seasonal adjustment models.\n\nQuality measures\n\nIn the lower part, the summary of the adjustment model shows various quality measures: The AICc and BIC information criterion and the QS, the Box-Ljung, and the Shapiro statistic. None of them shows any significance (indicated by one or several stars), which is a good sign. Various quality measures and their interpretation is shown in Chapter 15.\n\nRevisions\n\nWhen comparing seasonal adjustment models, the stability of the model and the series is often an important consideration. One does not want to get a different series with a new data point. X-13 offers tools to analyze revisions. Chapter 16 discusses them and helps you to decide which model to pick."

The default options of seas() are listed as explicit arguments and are discussed in the arguments section of the help page of\n\n3.6.1 Using X11\nWhile seas() calls SEATS by default, X11 is often easier to use.

Alternatively, you can also use an empty list, list().

These effects can be well-known and established, such as the length of a period or leap-year effects, or they can be more subjective such as a modification for a workers’ strike. We will see how this comes into the regARIMA model in Chapter 5. We can think of prior-modification factors as events or corrections made to your data that are fixed throughout the adjustment process. These prior modification factors can also be permanent (default) or temporary. Permanent modifications are excluded from the final seasonal adjustment. Temporary modifications are removed while calculating seasonal factors but added back to the seasonally adjusted series.\nThe second type is a nonlinear transformation applied to the observations. This is typically a choice between logarithmic transform and no transformation but for modeling can be any power of the Box-Cox transformation.\n\nm_none <- seas(AirPassengers, transform.function = \"none\")\nm_log  <- seas(AirPassengers, transform.function = \"log\")"

    "text": "4.2 Additive and multiplicative adjustment\nAs you remember from @sec-introduction, Seasonal adjustment decomposes a time series into a trend, a seasonal, and an irregular component. Algebraically, the fundamental identity of seasonal adjustment looks like this:\n\\[Y_t = T_t + S_t + I_t. \\tag{4.1}\\]\nWe seek the decompose our observed series \\(Y_t\\) into a trend \\(T_t\\), a seasonal \\(S_t\\), and an irregular \\(I_t\\) component. The formulation above is additive, i.e., the trend, the seasonal, and the irregular component sum up to the observed series. The goal of seasonal adjustment is to subtract the seasonal component:\n\\[A_t = Y_t - S_t.\\]\nFor example, an observed value of 100 with a seasonal factor of 3.2 would result in a seasonally adjusted value of 100 - 3.2 = 96.8.\nAlternatively, the decomposition can be multiplicative:\n\\[Y_t = T_t \\cdot S_t \\cdot I_t \\tag{4.2}\\]\nI.e., the observed series is the product of the trend and the seasonal and irregular components. Since these are factors, the goal of seasonal adjustment is to remove seasonality by dividing by the seasonal factor.\n\\[A_t = \\frac{Y_t}{S_t}.\\]\nFor example, an observed value of 100 with a seasonal factor of 1.08 would result in a seasonally adjusted value of 100 / 1.08 = 92.59259. Hence for multiplicative models, values of \\(S_t > 1\\) decrease the observed value, and \\(S_t < 1\\) increase it. Keep this in mind when viewing seasonal factors such as in the function monthplot(m).\nFor a multiplicative adjustment, it is sufficient to take logarithms of the initial series and re-transform the results after the decomposition. The transform spec takes care of this."

The choice is made by comparing the AICc1 value of an ARIMA (0 1 1)(0 1 1) model fit, or a user-specified ARIMA model, to the log-transformed series and the original series.1 With small sample sizes, a standard AIC test may select models with too many parameters. AICc tackles this problem by correcting for sample size.\nFor most practical purposes, this is an effective choice and can be left to the program to decide. If your series has negative values, it can not be log-transformed, and automatic selection is performed. Other restrictions on the allowed transformations exist, but these situations are rare. We can look at the results of the transformation tests by looking at specific statistics. The udg() function provides access to a large number of diagnostical statistics.The qs() function and the AIC(), BIC() and logLik() methods are wrappers that use udg() to access some specific diagnostical statistics.\n\nm <- seas(AirPassengers)\nudg(m, c(\"aictest.trans.aicc.nolog\", \"aictest.trans.aicc.log\"))\n#> aictest.trans.aicc.nolog   aictest.trans.aicc.log \n#>                1021.1919                 987.3845\n\nWe see the AICc for log transformation is lower and hence selected.

E.g.,\n\nout(m)\n\n\n\nThe choice between log and none changes the type of seasonal decomposition that will occur and, hence, your interpretation of the seasonal factors. With no transformation, X-13 will perform an additive seasonal adjustment specified in Equation 4.1. If log transformation is selected, X-13 will perform a multiplicative adjustment as specified in Equation 4.2."

    "text": "5.1 SARIMA model\nAs the name implies, there are two components that one needs to understand when fitting a regARIMA model; namely regression and ARIMA. Furthermore, the ARIMA part is made up by a differencing order and the stochastic ARMA portion. In this chapter, we try to break these three components down to the most fundamental ingredients without an overly technical exposition. Essentially, providing readers with enough information about each topic to understand the rest of this book and go off and perform satisfactory seasonal adjustment. The interested reader is encouraged to find material devoted to each of these components separately to more fully understand them.\nARIMA is an acronym describing the three parts of the modeling paradigm. AR = autoregressive, I = integrated (differenced), and MA = moving average. The prefix auto or “self”, explains the AR portion perfectly. We model the current observation with lagged values from the past. This is illustrated with the classic autoregressive model of order 1:\n\\[ Y_t = \\phi Y_{t-1} + a_t \\]\nwhere \\(Y_t\\) is the observed time series, \\(\\phi\\) is a coefficient to be estimated and \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) is an uncorrelated sequence of errors similar to that of standard linear regression. This model is notated AR(1). If instead of a single lag we used \\(p\\) lags, the model would be and AR(\\(p\\)) and have structure:\n\\[ Y_t = \\phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\phi_p Y_{t-p} + a_t \\]\nwhere now we have \\(p\\) coefficients \\(\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\ldots, \\phi_p\\) to be estimated.\nThe moving average part of ARIMA model is similar in notation and reflects the number of lagged values of the error sequence should be included. For example, an MA(1) model with coefficient parameter \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\\[ Y_t = a_t + \\theta a_{t-1} \\].\nNote that instead of doing self-regression we include past values of the unobserved errors in the model at time \\(t\\). If instead of a single lag we wanted \\(q\\) lags of the past error terms, we would have an MA(\\(q\\)) model:\n\\[ Y_t = a_t + \\theta_1 a_{t-1} + \\theta_2 a_{t-2} + \\cdots + \\theta_q a_{t-q} \\].\nWhen we combine these two ideas we can model \\(Y_t\\) with \\(p\\) lagged values of itself together with \\(q\\) lagged values of the unobserved errors. Together it makes an ARMA(\\(p\\), \\(q\\)) model, one of the fundamental ingredients to the regARIMA model. For a practitioner the automatic modeling done in X13 is often sufficient to find an appropriate value for \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and hence a well fitting ARMA model. If it more important from a seasonal adjustment perspective to correctly specify the differencing and regression variables in your overall regARIMA model."

    "text": "5.2 Differencing\nARMA models work best for stationary time series. This means the mean does not depend on time (such as increasing trend) or have a correlation structure that changes. Many techniques could be used to take a non-stationary time series and transform it to stationarity, one ubiquitous method is differencing. There is a famous results that states if you difference your series \\(k\\) times it will remove a polynomial trend of degree \\(k\\). Essentially, if you observe a time series with a linear trend then first differencing will remove the trend. If a time series has quadratic trend (polynomial of order 2) then differencing twice will remove that trend. A similar phenomenon can happen at seasonal lags and often a time series will also require seasonal differencing to reduce it to stationary. The order of differencing, also called the intgreation order, for the non-seaosnal and seasonal parts of our model are usually notated as \\(d\\) and \\(D\\) respectively. When we bring the integration order together with the stocastic model specification we have the notation \\[\\text{SARIMA}\\underbrace{(p, d, q)}_{\\text{non-seasonal }}\\underbrace{(P, D, Q)}_{\\text{seasonal}}.\\] This can be seen easily with an example. Consider the log transformed AirPassengers series.\n\nplot(log(AirPassengers))\n\n\n\n\nWe see a clear increasing trend and seasonal pattern. Let’s call the observed series \\(X_t\\). We can difference the series to make \\(Y_t = \\Delta X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}\\). A plot of \\(Y_t\\) looks like\n\nplot(diff(log(AirPassengers)))\n\n\n\n\nThe trend has been removed however some seasonal trend (strong seasonal patterns) still exist. Apply seasonal differencing to the already first differenced series \\(Y_t\\):\n\\[ Z_t = Y_t - Y_{t-12} \\]\nA plot of \\(Z_t\\):\n\nplot(diff(diff(log(AirPassengers)), 12))\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that both the original linear trend and seasonal pattern are removed and what is left is a stationary process that can adequately be modeled with an SARMA(0, 1)(0, 1) model. When you bring in the integration (differencing) order of one for the seasonal and non-seasonal components, we are left with the model named after this exact time series! The so called ``airline model’’ is the SARIMA(0, 1, 1)(0, 1, 1) and the terminology came to popularity via Box and Jenkins, “Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control” textbook."

    "text": "5.3 Fitting SARIMA (optional)\nHere we present a very oversimplied way to start to understand what values of \\(p, P, q\\) and \\(Q\\) you can investigate for your time series of interest. Recall that earlier it was mentioned that using automatic model identification is sufficient for most to get an adequate seasonal adjustment. Hence, this is simply for the interested reader to begin to gain additional intuition into the stochastic structures involved in their series and the types of structures the automatic modeling procedures look at. One of the main tools in a time series analyist tool box is the autocorrelation function (ACF). This is a function that returns the correlation between observations \\(h\\) time units apart throughout the entire sample. So for \\(h=2\\) this means looking at the correlation between the pairs \\((X_1, X_3), (X_2, X_4), (X_3, X_5), \\ldots\\). Then a way to build a SARIMA model is to match the sample ACF and the theoretical ACF of a given model. The main point distinguishing an AR(\\(p\\)) and MA(\\(q\\)) is how their theoretical ACF behaves. An AR(\\(p\\)) will have ACF the has exponential decay as \\(h\\) increases. For example, an AR(1) ACF is \\[\\rho(h) = \\phi^h\\] An MA(\\(q\\)) models ACF will be non-zero for the first \\(q\\) lags and then cutoff to zero thereafter. The ACF of an MA(1) is \\[\\rho(h) = \\begin{cases}\n~~1 & h = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\theta}{1 + \\theta^2} & h = 1 \\\\\n~~0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] In practice of course the difference between decay and cut-off can be nebulous to detect but the interested reader is encouraged to explore the arima.sim() function the look at the sample ACF with the acf() function. As you increase the sample size it will converge to the theoretical ACF value and you can start to see the structures just discussed.\n\nx_AR <- arima.sim(model = list(ar = .75), n = 300)\nx_MA <- arima.sim(model = list(ma = .75), n = 300)\ntsbox::ts_plot(cbind(x_AR, x_MA))\nop <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 2, 4, 2))\nacf(x_AR, xlab = \"h\", main = \"\"); title(\"ACF of AR(1) model\")\nacf(x_MA, xlab = \"h\", main = \"\"); title(\"ACF of MA(1) model\")\npar <- op"

    "text": "5.4 Regression\nWe have discussed SARIMA modeling (both the SARMA and differencing), now we see how exogenous regression variables come into play.\nThe regARIMA model takes the form \\[ f\\left(\\frac{Y_t}{D_t} \\right) = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\prime {\\mathbf X}_t + Z_t .\\] Here \\(Y_t\\) is the observed time series. The function \\(f\\) represents a transformation, most commonly used is the log transform ie \\(f(x) = \\log(x)\\). \\(D_t\\) is any intervention that has taken place prior to any transformation or modeling. This intervention is usually subjective and customized for individual series on an as-needed basis. For example, if a soybean farmer strike occurred and the soybean export series suffered for its duration. This type of event might adversely affect the seasonal adjustment filters and automatic model identification routines and can be mediated as an initial step. If no transformation or intervention is needed the model form is: \\[ Y_t = \\underbrace{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\prime {\\mathbf X}_t}_{\\text{Regression}} + \\underbrace{Z_t}_{\\text{ARIMA}} .\\]\nThe regression variables appear in the columns of the design matrix \\({\\mathbf X}_t\\) and \\(Z_t\\) is an ARIMA process. This last assumption on \\(Z_t\\) is what distinguished a regARIMA model from more classic linear models and multiple linear regression where error terms are assumed uncorrelated.\nIn order to achieve a suitable seasonal adjustment it is important to get the regARIMA model correct. For most dataset the built in automatic modeling features of the X13 program will be suitable to detect a reasonable model. This can be used as a starting point for more rigorous regARIMA model development or used as the final regARIMA modeling choice for your seasonal adjustment needs. We evoke automatic model identification through the XXX spec.

For example, roots near seasonal frequencies are associated with the seasonal component and roots near zero are associated with the trend component. \\[\n\\phi(B) = \\phi_T(B) \\cdot \\phi_S(B) \\cdot \\phi_R(B).\n\\]\nHence we have, \\[\nX_t =\n\\frac{\\theta(B)}{\\phi(B)} a_{t} =\n\\frac{\\theta_T(B)}{\\phi_T(B)} a_{T,t} +\n\\frac{\\theta_S(B)}{\\phi_S(B)} a_{S,t}  +\n\\frac{\\theta_R(B)}{\\phi_R(B)} a_{R,t}  + u_t\n\\]\nIf the spectra of all components in non-negative the decomposition is admissible, SEATS finds admissible models for components \\[ \\phi_T(B) T_t = \\theta_T(B) a_{T, t} \\] \\[ \\phi_S(B) S_t = \\theta_S(B) a_{S, t} \\] \\[\\phi_R(B) R_t = \\theta_R(B) a_{R, t} \\] Problem: Infinite number of models that yield the same aggregate.

    "text": "7.1 Additive and multiplicative (again)\nThe X-13ARIMA-SEATS development was highly motivated to study economic time series. As such, the default seasonal adjustment mode is multiplicative due to most seasonal economic time series displaying seasonal fluctuations that increase and decrease along with the level of the time series.\nIf your series does not have this feature then additive adjustment might be more appropriate. This can be changed in the mode argument of the x11 spec. For example, seas(x, x11.mode = 'add') will perform an additive x11 run. There exist two other models for decomposition, pseudo-additive and log additive. These are less common than additive and multiplicative models and are not the focus of this text. If your series has some extremely small values in certain months (quarters) then pseudo-additive models could be worth further investigation. It has been observed that when multiplicative seasonal adjustment produces more extreme values in conjunction with small seasonal factors then pseudo-additive adjustment should be explored.

    "text": "7.2 Filter length\nThe X11 spec also allows users to control the length of the trend and seasonal moving average filters used during the adjustment. Generally speaking, longer filters imply a more stable seasonal component and shorter filters a more changing seasonal pattern. Of course, a longer filter will use more data for the caluclation of components at each time point. This is an important observation and understanding it might help a user decide on a short or long filter. Since longer filters use more data there tend to be smaller revisions when a new data point is added. However, there will be revisions to data values further back.\nA shorter filter is just the opposite, they tend to produce smaller revisions but they do not extend as far back into the series. If a filter is not choosen by the user then automatic filter selection is used. To understand the length of a filter let’s look at the (finite) number of choice available in during an x11 adjustment. Table 7.1 shows the different filters available for the seasonal component and the trend component.\n\n\nTable 7.1: Filters available in X11\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n\ns3x1\n3×1 moving average\n\n\ns3x3\n3×3 moving average\n\n\ns3x5\n3×5 moving average\n\n\ns3x9\n3×9 moving average\n\n\ns3x15\n3×15 moving average\n\n\nstable\nStable seasonal filter.
