SEATS = "Signal Extraction in ARIMA Time Series"

Both X-11 method and SEATS assume the observed time series is a function of latent (unobserved) components.
$$
X_t = S_t + N_t
$$
where $S_t$ is a seasonal component and $N_t$ is a non-seasonal component.

Usually the non-seasonal component is broken down further into trends, cycles, transitory, etc.

$$
X_t = T_t + S_t + I_t
$$

Ultimately, both X-11 and SEATS estimate the components $T_t$, $S_t$, $I_t$ by passing moving average filters over the forecast extended series.

*X-11 Filters*:

* finite set of empirically developed moving average filters
*	fixed filtering seen as easier to use (less statistical machinery)

*SEATS filters*:

* specifies stochastic models for unobserved components
* derives seasonal adjustment filters from these models
* infinite number of possible filter choices
* requires more statistical machinery 

Sometimes SEATS includes a transitory component in its decomposition:

$$ X_t = T_t + S_t + R_t + u_t $$

The transitory component captures short, erratic behavior 
that is not white noise, sometimes associated with awkward 
frequencies.

* The variation from the transitory component should not 
contaminate the trend or seasonal, and removing it allows SEATS to obtain smoother, more stable trends and seasonal components.
* In the final decomposition, the transitory and irregular 
components are usually combined.
* SEATS does not always estimate a transitory component


## Quick refresher on ARIMA models and notation

The remaining of the SEATS section will heavily rely on the autoregressive and moving-average operators $\phi(B)$ and $\theta(B)$ where $B X_t = X_{t-1}$.

If $X_t$ follows and ARIMA($p$, $d$, $q$) model:
$$
\phi(B) X_t = \theta(B) a_t 
$$

$$
(1 - \phi_1 B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d X_t = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots \theta_q B^q) a_t
$$

For example, in an ARIMA(2,0,1) we are modeling $X_t$ as:

$$
X_t = \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + a_t + \theta_1 a_{t-1}
$$

and all model information is contained in $\phi(B)$ and $\theta(B)$.
Moreover, for any specified $\phi(B)$ and $\theta(B)$ that satisfy certain causality criteria there exists a unique Wold decomposition
$$
\phi(B) X_t = \theta(B) a_t  
$$

$$
X_t = \frac{\theta(B)}{\phi(B)} a_t = \Psi(B) a_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \psi_k a_{t-k}
$$

## SEATS Assumptions

* The linearized series can be represented by an ARIMA model which captures the stochastic structure of the series (Linearized series = series with regression effects removed)
* After differencing each with the ARIMAâ€™s differencing polynomial, the components are orthogonal (uncorrelated)

SEATs decomposes the autoregressive polynomial by its roots associating them with different latent components. 
For example, roots near seasonal frequencies are associated with the seasonal component and roots near zero are associated with the trend component. 
$$
\phi(B) = \phi_T(B) \cdot \phi_S(B) \cdot \phi_R(B).
$$

Hence we have,
$$
X_t = 
\frac{\theta(B)}{\phi(B)} a_{t} = 
\frac{\theta_T(B)}{\phi_T(B)} a_{T,t} +
\frac{\theta_S(B)}{\phi_S(B)} a_{S,t}  +
\frac{\theta_R(B)}{\phi_R(B)} a_{R,t}  + u_t
$$

If the spectra of all components in non-negative the decomposition is admissible, SEATS finds admissible models for components
$$ \phi_T(B) T_t = \theta_T(B) a_{T, t} $$
$$ \phi_S(B) S_t = \theta_S(B) a_{S, t} $$
$$\phi_R(B) R_t = \theta_R(B) a_{R, t} $$
*Problem:* Infinite number of models that yield the same aggregate. The choices differ in how white noise is allocated among the components.
*Solution:* Canonical Decomposition: SEATS uses the method of Pierce, Box-Hillmer, Tiao and Burman:

* Put all the white noise into the irregular components
* Maximize the variance of the irregular
* Minimizes the variance of the stationary transforms of the other components

This is called the *Canonical Decomposition*. We already stated that both X-11 and SEATS estimate the unobserved components by passing a moving-average filter over the observed data. So how do we use these implied component models to get a linear filter? It should be clear that the filter weights will depend on that arima model is picked $X_t = \Psi(B) a_t$, and what the implied seasonal model, $\phi_S(B) S_t = \theta_S(B) a_{S,t} \Rightarrow S_t = \Psi(B) a_t$, is. The **Wiener-Kolmogorov** (WK) algorithm outlines the methodology to get the so-called WK filter. This is the filter that is equal to the conditional expectation of the seasonal component conditional on the observed series.  
$$\widehat{S}_t = \underbrace{\left[ \frac{\Sigma_S}{\Sigma} \frac{\Psi_S(B)\Psi_S(F)}{\Psi(B)\Psi(F)} \right]}_{\mbox{WK filter weights}} X_t$$
where $F=B^{-1}$ if the forward shift operator such that $F X_t = X_{t+1}$.

More than other coefficients, the seasonal MA ($\theta_{12}$) influences whether estimated seasonal factors change either slowly over time ($\theta_{12}$ close to 1) or rapidly over time ($\theta_{12}$ close to zero).

## Example SEATS adjustment

## Some existing studies and conclusions

The Bureau of Labor Statistics formed a group to do a comparison study between X-11 and model-based seasonal adjustments (CITE BLS 2007). The examined a cross section of 87 BLS series with X-11, SEATS, and STAMP using spectral, revisions history, model adequacy and sliding spans diagnostics. They found that SEATS seasonal factors are usually more stable than X-11 and X-11 trend component is usually more stable than SEATS. Also, among series that were seasonal, residual seasonality almost never appears using either method. The only exception being a small number of  SEATS runs where model inadequacy for the full span of data was present. This manifested as SEATS having difficulty identifying a usable model for decomposition and falling back on the airline model. They found even in these situations the SEATS seasonal adjustment is usually reasonable. 

Overall, X-11 and SEATS seasonal adjustments are very similar for many series. 
SEATS adjustments are often smoother than X-11 seasonal adjustments. For some series, the variance can be different based on the month or season. For example, U.S. Housing Starts is more variable in the winter months than in the summer due to the differences in warm and cold winters. ARIMA model-based seasonal adjustment does not handle this situation very well and assumes a constant variance and the SEATS adjustment wont compensate for this.
