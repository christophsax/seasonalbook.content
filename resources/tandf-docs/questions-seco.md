- weh: If an additional data point causes SEATS to automatically select the model, should the model be changed in this case? Or is it opportune to set an outlier? What if setting an outlier still results in a different model choice? 

- Weh: I choose a plausible model during the annual revision (meets the relevant statistics, seasonal pattern looks stable, outlier set where necessary). In the next quarter, the adjusted series revises sharply. How to avoid choosing a model that is revision prone?

- Fia: I choose a plausible model during the annual revision (meets relevant statistics, seasonal pattern looks stable, outlier set where necessary). In the next quarters, the unadjusted series revises strongly and so does the adjusted series. Should revisions in the past be prevented by outliers or should it be assumed that the new estimate is less biased because the revised series is closer to the final series?

- Fia: What is the optimal approach when a series has a clear break in the seasonal pattern with a short transition period in between? 

- Fia: Advantages and disadvantages of SEATS vs. X11.

- Net: What tests should all be run to decide whether to purge a series? What if these tests contradict each other?

- Net: How to check the revision susceptibility of seasonal adjustment models? 

- Net: What tests / statistics should be looked at by default to assess the goodness of a model? Q-test, normal distribution, month plot,... ? 

- Net: When to use SEATS, when to use X11?

- Net: What is the best way to balance between the simplest possible model (0 1 1)(0 1 1) and the more complex model suggested by the algorithm?

- Net: for national accounts, should one rather adjust nominal and real series or better the real series and the deflator? 

- Weh: should one reset the estimation parameters every quarter or set the seasonal factors once a year?

- Weh: should one generally seasonally adjust even if it is not clear whether the series has a natural season?

- Wis: When choosing the seasonal adjustment model, no model can be found that meets all tests (QS, Box-Ljung, Shapiro). What decision process (criteria) do I follow to find the best model?

- Wis: I choose a plausible model during the annual revision (meets relevant statistics, seasonal pattern looks stable, outlier set where needed). In the coming quarters, outliers set in the past are no longer significant. How do I deal with these outliers?

- Wis: Case: Based on the statistics, both a simple model and a more complex model meet the criteria. However, the more complex model performs slightly better. In such a case, do I always choose the "best" model?

- Wis: Case: Based on the statistics, several models meet the statistical criteria. Is there a way to check in advance which models are more stable to revisions?
